**Credit Prediction API**

A simple RESTful API that predicts a user's creditworthiness (credit score–like value) based on their financial data using Machine Learning.

Built with ❤️ using FastAPI + Scikit-Learn, this project is designed to help developers or fintech apps integrate credit prediction functionality into their systems.

🚀** Features**

🔮 Predict creditworthiness from financial data

⚡ Fast and lightweight (built on FastAPI)

🧠 Machine learning model trained on sample credit data

🧩 Ready for integration into web or mobile apps

🛡️ Clean structure and modular code
**
🧰 Tech Stack**

**Backend:** FastAPI (Python)

**ML Model:** Scikit-Learn

**Data Processing: **Pandas, NumPy

**Server:** Uvicorn (for local hosting)

⚙️ **Installation & Setup**
1️⃣ Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-prediction-api.git
cd credit-prediction-api

2️⃣** Create a virtual environment**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

3️⃣** Install dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣** Run the API**
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

🔗** Endpoints**
POST /predict

Description: Predict a user’s credit score range

Request Body (JSON):

{
  "age": 29,
  "income": 45000,
  "loan_amount": 12000,
  "employment_status": "Full-Time",
  "credit_history": 4
}


Response (JSON):

{
  "credit_score": 720,
  "risk_level": "Low"
}

🧠 **How It Works (Simplified)**

User sends their financial info via POST request.

API validates data using Pydantic schemas.

The trained ML model predicts the user’s creditworthiness.

Response returns credit score + risk level.

🌍** Deployment**

You can host this API easily on:

Render

Railway

Vercel (Serverless FastAPI)

AWS / GCP / Azure

💡** Real-World Use Cases**

🏦 Fintech apps checking user eligibility

💳 Loan approval systems

📱 Credit simulation for learning/finance apps

🧾 Data dashboards for financial risk analysis

🧩 Future Improvements

Connect to real user data (CIBIL-style APIs)

Add user authentication

Store prediction history in DB

Create frontend dashboard
